Thank-you everyone for your patience...it's been a while and I'm glad you haven't given up on BadgeGen.


I've skimmed through the past many months of posts, and made most of the changes that I identified as necessary as well as added some new things here and there.  I plan on this being a relativlely short Beta, but since I'm rusty with my GSAK coding, I feel it needs some testing first.


[b]Changes since release V3.2.10:[/b]
 1)  Removed geocoin ad as geocoins are long gone
 2)  Elevation now uses built in elevation feature of GSAK (which requires GSAK V8.4.0, I believe)
 3)  Giga events now counted in Mega event total.  They are so few that it's pointless to award a separate badge. Additionally, hosting a Giga event counts toward hosted events tally.
 4)  Fix "Most Types in a Day" calculation (see: [URL=http://gsak.net/board/index.php?showtopic=26156&view=findpost&p=197414]this post[/URL])



3)  #-Output style improved...it was looking a bit old
#-Test run of Nx diamond badges added for 5/5 badge.
