[SIZE=14][b]V3.3.0 BETA[/b][/SIZE]

Thank-you everyone for your patience...it's been a while and I'm glad you haven't given up on BadgeGen.


I've skimmed through the past many months of posts, and made most of the changes that I identified as necessary as well as added some new things here and there.  I plan on this being a relatively short-lived Beta, but since I'm rusty with my GSAK coding, I feel it needs some testing first.


[b]Changes since release V3.2.10:[/b]
 Maintenance:
 1)  Removed BadgeGen Geocoin advertisement as geocoins are sold out.
 2)  Elevation now uses built in elevation feature of GSAK (which requires GSAK V8.4.0, I believe)
 3)  Giga events now counted in Mega event total.  They are so few that it's pointless to award a separate badge. Additionally, hosting a Giga event counts toward hosted events tally.
 4)  Fix "Most Types in a Day" calculation (see: [URL=http://gsak.net/board/index.php?showtopic=26156&view=findpost&p=197414]this post[/URL])

 New Stuff:
 5) Output styling improved.  You'll notice a few changes to the output, especially if you choose the "sort badges" option.  The updated HTML has been tested with FindStatGen3 and on my Geocaching.com profile page, but I can't anticipate all of the places that BadgeGen output will end up, so if the new HTML/CSS breaks in your specific use, please let me know.  Overall, I'm happy with the changes...let me know what you think!

Also, I'm considering removing the option to not sort badges.  If you really don't want your badges sorted, speak now or forever hold your peace :).
 
 
6) Now, if you achieve two (or more) times the Diamond requirement for [i]most[/i] badges, BadgeGen will now show a small integer "sticker" on the output badge (see [URL=http://gsak.net/board/index.php?showtopic=17930&view=findpost&p=223588]here[/URL] for the discussion).  Ironically, it does not yet work for the subject of the suggestion, "The Matrix Cacher".  A completely separate (and inherently more difficult) calculation needs to be done to implement this, and I need to think about it a bit more.  As of now, it works for up to 9x diamond, where appropriate.  If you exceed 9x diamond on something, please let me know as I want to congratulate you.  :P   

Some badges just do not make sense for this new feature (e.g. 2x diamond for the Head-in-the-Clouds is higher than Mt. Everest) and have been omitted.

I'll admit I have not thoroughly tested this with all badges, so I suspect bugs. Please inform.
